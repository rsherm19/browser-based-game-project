*Spaceman Baseball* is a browser game that utilizes the rules of the game "Spaceman" but with a baseball theme. Rather than drawing a different body part of a man upon each wrong answer, the game counts your strikes, similar to baseball. Then, when you answer a correct answer, your strikes reset, and the letter is added to the correct letter display. Each wrong letter is added to the wrong letter display, also.

I chose "Spaceman"  because it was not too difficult, still it allowed a lot of freedom to be creative and experiment. I also like baseball, so I figued it would be cool to incorporate a baseball theme.

# Getting Started
[<u>Click here to play!</u>](https://rsherm19.github.io/spaceman-baseball/)

Guess the correct letters of a baseball term to win! If you guess wrong, you will get a strike, and the letter will go to the wrong letters list. Each time you get a correct letter, your strikes reset! Play ball!
